# PHP-LOW-PRACTICE 

* Bootstrap 5.1
* PHP 7.4+

Demonstration of the easy use of php and boostrap to do something simple and basic

If you don't want to waste time you can use the crundesio.sql install all the tables and columns to see the result.


Edit File: conn.php (Database and Root)


This is practical, so the codes have security flaws and sql injection can be done, which I do not know if I will correct them, but I will try to patch and improve this project, even if it is practical.

sorry for my english :')
